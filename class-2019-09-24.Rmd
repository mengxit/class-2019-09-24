  class_enrollment <-read_xlsx("class_enrollment_summary_by_term_9.17.19.xlsx", skip = 3,na = c("", "NA"), trim_ws = TRUE) %>%
  clean_names() %>%

  filter(!is.na(course_name))
```

```{r cars}
  max_undergrad_gov <- class_enrollment %>% arrange(desc(u_grad)) %>% filter(course_department == "Government")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
